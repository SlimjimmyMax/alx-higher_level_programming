# Web Fundamentals

## URL Basics

- **What a URL is:** A URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is a reference or address used to access resources on the internet, such as web pages, images, or files.

- **How to read a URL:** A URL typically consists of a scheme (e.g., http), domain name (e.g., www.example.com), optional port number, path, and query parameters.

- **Scheme for an HTTP URL:** The scheme for an HTTP URL is typically "http" or "https" for secure connections.

- **Domain Name:** A domain name is a human-readable address that points to a specific IP address on the internet.

- **Sub-Domain:** A sub-domain is a part of a larger domain. For example, "blog" in "blog.example.com" is a sub-domain.

- **Port Number in a URL:** Port numbers, if specified, come after the domain name and are preceded by a colon (e.g., http://example.com:8080).

- **Query String:** A query string is a part of the URL that contains parameters for the resource being requested, often used for dynamic content.

## HTTP Basics

- **HTTP Request:** An HTTP request is a message sent by a client (e.g., browser) to request a specific action from a server.

- **HTTP Response:** An HTTP response is the message sent by a server in response to an HTTP request.

- **HTTP Headers:** HTTP headers provide additional information about the request or response, such as content type, date, or server information.

- **HTTP Message Body:** The HTTP message body contains the actual data being sent in an HTTP request or response.

- **HTTP Request Method:** The HTTP request method defines the type of operation the client wants to perform (e.g., GET, POST, PUT).

- **HTTP Response Status Code:** The HTTP response status code indicates the result of the requested operation (e.g., 200 OK, 404 Not Found).

- **HTTP Cookie:** An HTTP cookie is a small piece of data stored on the user's device, used to track user information or session state.

## cURL and Browser Interaction

- **Making a Request with cURL:** cURL is a command-line tool for making HTTP requests. For example: `curl http://example.com`.

- **Browser Interaction:** When you type "google.com" in your browser, an application-level process begins. The browser initiates a DNS lookup, establishes an HTTP connection, sends an HTTP request to the server, receives an HTTP response, renders the HTML, and executes any associated scripts to display the webpage.
